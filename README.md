# Heart-Disease-Prediction
Heart disease is a major cause of death worldwide, and early detection is essential for effective
treatment and prevention. Machine learning techniques have been increasingly used to predict
heart disease risk by analyzing patient data. In this project, we aim to develop a predictive model
for heart disease using machine learning techniques.We used a publicly available dataset from
the UCI Machine Learning Repository, which contains clinical and demographic data from 303
patients with heart disease. We performed exploratory data analysis to gain insights into the data
and prepare it for modeling. We then used various machine learning algorithms, including
logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, and support vector machines, to build
predictive models.Our results showed that the random forest algorithm outperformed the other
models, achieving an accuracy of 87% in predicting heart disease risk. We also identified the
most important features for predicting heart disease, including age, maximum heart rate
achieved, and the presence of chest pain.Our study demonstrates the potential of machine
learning techniques in predicting heart disease risk. This could help clinicians to identify patients
at high risk of heart disease and develop appropriate prevention and treatment strategies.The
purpose of this study work is to predict the likelihood that patients would -develop heart disease.
The findings show that K-nearest Neighbor achieves the highest accuracy score. The clinical
analysis of the disease’s risk factors and the interpretation of the patient’s situation can both
benefit from this prediction. Enhancing the algorithm produced encouraging results to anticipate
signs of heart disease. By focusing on the condition’s risk factors more, it can be improved still
more.
