# Heart Disease Prediction App - Full Guide


Part 1: How to Use the Heart Disease Prediction App
---------------------------------------------------

Step 1: Open the Jupyter Notebook
- Launch Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab
- Open the file "Heart Disease Prediction.ipynb"

Step 2: Load the Dataset
- The dataset (e.g., "dataset.csv") is loaded using pandas
- Includes patient information like age, sex, blood pressure, cholesterol, etc.

Step 3: Explore and Clean the Data
- Checks for missing values, duplicates, or irrelevant columns
- May include label encoding or normalization if required

Step 4: Feature Selection and Preprocessing
- Splits the dataset into features (X) and target (y)
- May perform scaling using StandardScaler or MinMaxScaler
- Optionally visualizes correlations or distributions using seaborn/matplotlib

Step 5: Split the Dataset
- Dataset is split into training and testing sets (e.g., 70:30 or 80:20 ratio)
- Done using train_test_split from sklearn

Step 6: Train Machine Learning Models
- Trains one or more classifiers:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Random Forest Classifier
  - K-Nearest Neighbors
  - Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Each model is fitted on the training data

Step 7: Evaluate the Models
- Makes predictions on the test set
- Displays performance metrics:
  - Accuracy score
  - Confusion matrix
  - Precision, recall, F1-score
- May also include ROC Curve or classification report

Step 8: Make Custom Predictions
- Provides a section to input custom values (e.g., age, cholesterol)
- Model predicts whether the person has heart disease (1) or not (0)

Part 2: How to Run or Modify the App
------------------------------------

Step 1: Install Dependencies
- Make sure the following Python libraries are installed:
  - pandas
  - numpy
  - matplotlib
  - seaborn
  - scikit-learn

Step 2: Launch Jupyter Notebook
- Open Anaconda Prompt or Terminal
- Navigate to the folder and run:
  jupyter notebook

Step 3: Open the Notebook File
- Click on "Heart Disease Prediction.ipynb"
- Run all cells sequentially from top to bottom

Step 4: Modify or Extend
- You can add more models or change hyperparameters
- Consider saving the best model using joblib or pickle for deployment

Part 4: Function Descriptions (If Functions Are Used)
-----------------------------------------------------

1. load_data()
- Reads CSV file into a pandas DataFrame

2. preprocess_data(df)
- Cleans, scales, or encodes data as needed

3. train_models(X_train, y_train)
- Trains ML models on training data

4. evaluate_model(model, X_test, y_test)
- Calculates and prints accuracy and confusion matrix

5. predict_custom_input(model, input_values)
- Returns prediction for user-defined input
